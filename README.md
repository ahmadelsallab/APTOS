According to [this article](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-complications/diabetic-retinopathy.html):

- Diabetic retinopathy is the most common form of diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy usually only affects people who have had diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) for a significant number of years.
- Retinopathy can affect all diabetics and becomes particularly dangerous, increasing the risk of blindness, if it is left untreated.
-The risk of developing diabetic retinopathy is known to increase with age as well with less well controlled blood sugar and blood pressure level.
- According to the NHS, 1,280 new cases of blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy are reported each year in England alone, while a further 4,200 people in the country are thought to be at risk of retinopathy-related vision loss.
All people with diabetes should have a dilated eye examination at least once every year to check for diabetic retinopathy.
